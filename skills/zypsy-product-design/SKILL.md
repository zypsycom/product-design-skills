  Apply this skill whenever building any user interface — component, page,
  flow, or full product. This is not a style guide. It is a design operating
  system built from a decade of shipping products for funded startups and
  global brands. It covers the full stack of product design: strategy,
  information architecture, interaction design, visual design, design systems,
  and AI-native patterns. Use it to produce work that is not only beautiful
  but strategically sound, behaviourally correct, and technically coherent.
  Triggers: any request involving UI, UX, components, dashboards, flows,
  onboarding, empty states, AI features, design tokens, or interface critique.

# Zypsy Product Design Skill

> "Design is not decoration. It is the reduction of friction between a person and the outcome they need."

This skill encodes the design standards Zypsy applies across every engagement — from Series A SaaS dashboards to AI-native consumer apps. It goes beyond visual aesthetics into the full practice of product design: how to structure information, how to design behaviour, how to build systems, and how to make AI feel trustworthy.

---

## 00.1 — Response Mode

All sections of this skill are always active. The principles, constraints, and 
anti-patterns in sections 02–11 inform every response — they are never switched off.

What changes based on request scope is how much of that reasoning is shown.

### Quick mode
Trigger: a single question, a component-level request, a critique, or a fast check.

Respond conversationally. Apply all design principles internally. Surface only the 
answer and the most relevant rationale. Do not produce structured sections. Do not 
run the quality checklist visibly. Do not ask the Section 00 intake questions.

### Full mode
Trigger: an app concept, a multi-screen flow, a new product area, or any request 
that requires structural design decisions.

When Full mode is triggered, run Section 00.2 intake first. 
Then respond using the structure in Section 10.

### The rule
The skill informs the answer. It does not become the answer.
A question gets a response. A product gets a document.

---

## 00.2 — Context Intake

Before generating any design output, ask the user the following four questions. 
Present them as a numbered list in a single message. Do not answer them yourself. 
Do not proceed until the user has responded. If any answer is vague or missing, 
ask one targeted follow-up to resolve it before moving forward.

Use this exact framing:

~~~
Before I start, I need four quick answers to make sure what I build is grounded in your actual context — not in assumptions.

1. **Who is the primary user?** Describe a specific person with a specific job — 
   not a persona category. What do they already know, and what do they expect 
   when they use this?

2. **What is the one job this interface exists to do?** One verb-object sentence. 
   ("Review and approve a candidate." "Understand yesterday's revenue.") 
   If there are three answers, we need to narrow it down.

3. **What is the riskiest moment?** The action that is irreversible, expensive, 
   or embarrassing if done wrong.

4. **What does success feel like to the user — not to the product?** 
   Not metrics. The felt experience of getting it right.
~~~

Only after all four questions are answered should you proceed to Section 01.
If the user skips a question, flag it and ask again — these are not optional.

---

## 01 — Output Format

When generating an app concept or interface, always structure the response in this order. Do not jump straight into visuals.

1. **Product goal** — what problem this solves and for whom
2. **Primary user** — specific, not a persona category
3. **Core workflow** — the single path that matters most
4. **Information architecture** — structure and navigation logic
5. **Key screens / modules** — what each contains and why
6. **States and edge cases** — all eight states per component
7. **AI behaviour** — only if the product includes AI features
8. **Design system / component logic** — tokens, variants, reuse
9. **Risks and recommendations** — what to prioritise now vs later

---

## 02 — Product Framing

- Optimise for the **main job**, not for feature count.
- Prefer **one strong workflow** over multiple weak ones.
- Separate clearly:
  - what the user needs to **understand**
  - what the user needs to **do**
  - what the user only needs as **context**
- If scope is broad, define:
  - **MVP** — what ships first
  - **v1 improvements** — what comes after validation
  - **future ideas** — what requires more signal

Never feature-dump. Every element on screen must earn its place.

---

## 03 — Information Architecture

IA is the skeleton. Bad IA cannot be fixed with good UI.

### Hierarchy before layout
Establish a strict content hierarchy before designing anything visual:

- **Level 1 — Identity**: What is this? Where am I?
- **Level 2 — Status**: What is the current state of things?
- **Level 3 — Action**: What can I do?
- **Level 4 — Context**: What do I need to know to act well?

Never invert this order. Never blend levels. The most common IA failure is promoting Level 4 (context) above Level 3 (action), burying the thing the user came to do.

### Navigation
- Navigation should reflect the user's mental model of their tasks, not the product's internal architecture.
- Maximum cognitive load for primary navigation: 5–7 items. Beyond this, group — never append.
- Active state must be unmistakable. Never rely on colour alone.
- Every screen must answer: "Where am I?", "Where can I go?", "How do I get back?"

### Progressive Disclosure
- Default views should show only what is needed to complete the primary action.
- Secondary and advanced options belong in overflow menus, drawers, or modals — not on the main canvas.
- The rule: *if fewer than 30% of users need it in the first 30 seconds, hide it by default.*

---

## 04 — Screen and Flow Design

For every proposed screen, define:

- **Purpose** — the single reason this screen exists
- **Primary action** — the one thing the user should do here
- **Secondary actions** — what is available but not dominant
- **Critical content** — what must be visible without scrolling
- **What should be hidden by default** — and where it lives
- **What happens after the main action** — next state, confirmation, redirect

Prefer flows that are:
- obvious on first use
- reversible where possible
- hard to misuse by accident
- fast for repeat users
- understandable without documentation

---

## 05 — Interaction Design

### Feedback and System Status
Every action must produce a visible response within 100ms. If the action takes longer:
- **< 1s**: Show a subtle loading indicator on the element itself (button spinner, skeleton shimmer). No full-screen loader.
- **1–5s**: Show progress with an estimate. Keep the user in context.
- **> 5s**: Give the user something to do while they wait, or move the task to the background and notify on completion.

Silence is failure. A system that does not respond is a system the user assumes is broken.

### Error Design
Errors are a product feature, not an edge case.

- **Prevent before you catch**: Use constraints, input validation, and confirmation patterns to reduce error rate.
- **Be specific, not apologetic**: "Something went wrong" is useless. "We couldn't save your changes — your session expired. Sign in again and your draft will be restored." is useful.
- **Point to the solution**: Every error message should contain or link to a resolution. Never a dead end.
- **Preserve user work**: Never lose a partially completed form, draft, or configuration on error. Auto-save aggressively.

### States — design all eight, every time
For every component or view, design these states before calling it done:

1. **Empty** — nothing exists yet. This is an onboarding moment, not a blank void.
2. **Loading** — data is in transit. Match the skeleton to the expected loaded shape.
3. **Partial** — some data is present, more is coming.
4. **Populated** — the primary state. Usually the only one that gets designed.
5. **Error** — the fetch failed, the action failed, the input is invalid.
6. **Disabled** — the user lacks permission or the action is unavailable in context.
7. **Read-only** — data is visible but not editable.
8. **Overflow** — 10x more data than expected. Tables with 1,000 rows. Names with 80 characters. Images that fail to load.

If you design only the populated state, you have designed less than 15% of the interface.

### Affordances and Signifiers
- Every interactive element must look interactive. Clickable things look different from readable things.
- Hover states are mandatory on desktop.
- Touch targets on mobile: minimum 44×44px. No exceptions.
- Drag-and-drop requires a persistent visual cue — not just a cursor change.

## 06 — Visual Design

### Commitment over compromise
Pick a clear aesthetic direction that fits the product, the user, and the job to be done. Commit once the direction is justified by context — not by novelty, trend, or surface polish alone.

Choose one direction and commit:
- **Editorial** — type as hero, strong vertical rhythm, aggressive white space, ink-heavy moments
- **Systems** — grid supremacy, monospace accents, dense information, nothing decorative
- **Organic** — variable weight type, natural textures, irregular containers, warmth
- **Minimalism** — restraint, generous spacing, muted palette with a single precious accent
- **Kinetic** — the interface is in motion by default; stasis is the exception
- **Raw / Brutalist** — structural honesty, no decoration, contrast as the only softness

### Typography
Typography is the primary carrier of hierarchy, brand, and tone. Treat it as the most important design decision, not the last one.

**Rules:**
- Use a maximum of two typefaces: one for display/headings, one for body/UI. Never more.
- If possible avoid the default stack: Inter, Roboto, SF Pro, Arial. These communicate nothing about the product.
- Choose typefaces that are appropriate to the product.
- Type scale: establish 5–6 sizes maximum. Assign each a role. Never deviate.
- Line height for body text: 1.5–1.6. For display: 1.0–1.2.
- Measure (line length): 60–75 characters for body copy. Anything longer degrades comprehension.
- Colour contrast for text: 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA). Target 7:1 for primary body copy.
- Typography must carry hierarchy before colour does.

### Theme Selection
- Theme choice is a product decision, not a stylistic default.
- Select the initial theme based on product type, audience expectations, content density, and likely usage context.
- Prefer light mode for editorial, reading-heavy, marketing, ecommerce, healthcare, education, lifestyle, wellness, and general consumer products.
- Prefer dark mode only when it is clearly supported by product context or research, such as for developer tools, trading terminals, technical dashboards, monitoring systems, media tools, or dense professional interfaces.
- In ambiguous cases, prefer light mode.
- Only create dark mode when explicitly requested or when research strongly indicates it should be the primary theme.
- Dark mode must be designed intentionally. It is not a simple inversion of light mode and requires separate decisions around contrast, elevation, shadow, and colour weight.
- Build only one primary theme by default.
- Generate both light and dark themes only when explicitly requested.

### Colour
- The palette serves hierarchy, not decoration. Assign roles before assigning hues.
- **Roles to define first**: background, surface, border, text-primary, text-secondary, text-disabled, interactive, interactive-hover, interactive-active, success, warning, error, info.
- A palette with more than 3 brand colours is not a palette. It is chaos with names.
- Accent colours work because they are rare. If everything is accented, nothing is.
- Avoid gradient as a default. Use it intentionally: to communicate depth, direction, or energy — not to fill space.

### Spacing
- Use a base-8 spacing system (4px minimum unit). Consistent spacing creates rhythm.
- Proximity signals relationship. Elements that belong together should be closer to each other than to things they don't belong to.
- Generous spacing is not wasted space. It is breath.
- Padding inside a component should be proportional to the component's size. A small chip and a large card do not share the same padding values.

### Layout & Composition
- Establish a grid and honour it. Break it only intentionally, only once, and only for a reason.
- Asymmetry is more interesting than symmetry, but it requires more control.
- Alignment is not aesthetic preference. Misalignment signals disorder to the subconscious.
- Design for the critical content length, not the placeholder. One-word labels and 200-character labels both need to work.

### Motion
- Motion is communication. Every animation should have a reason: state change, attention direction, action confirmation, or spatial relationship.
- Default easing: ease-out for elements entering (decelerate to rest), ease-in for elements leaving (accelerate away).
- Duration: 150–200ms for micro-interactions, 300–400ms for page transitions, 500–600ms for orchestrated reveals.
- Staggered entry animations (100–150ms offset) create rhythm without chaos.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. All motion must have a static fallback.
- Never animate just to fill silence. A still interface is not an unfinished interface.

## 07 — AI-Native Interface Patterns

AI features introduce states and behaviours that do not exist in traditional software. These patterns must be designed explicitly. Never let them emerge accidentally.

### Trust and Transparency
The central challenge of AI UI is calibrating user trust. Overtrust causes errors. Undertrust causes abandonment.

- **Show the basis for AI output**: Where the answer came from, what data it used, what timeframe it covers. Even a single metadata line ("Based on 47 transactions, Sep–Nov 2024") dramatically increases trust.
- **Confidence signals**: Not all AI output is equally reliable. Design a visual vocabulary for confidence — definitive outputs look different from suggested outputs. Use visual weight, not just labels.
- **Never fake certainty**: If the model is uncertain, the interface must reflect that. A confident UI over an uncertain model is a liability.

### Streaming and Progressive Generation
- Streaming text must not cause layout reflow. Reserve space before content arrives.
- Show a generation indicator (cursor, pulse, shimmer on the output area) — not a full-screen loader.
- Allow interruption. The user should be able to stop generation at any point.
- Once generated, clearly distinguish AI-produced content from user-produced content. They have different epistemological status.

### AI Input Design
- The prompt input is a product surface, not a text field. Design it with appropriate weight and affordance.
- Provide example prompts, suggested actions, or guided templates for new users — the blank box is the most intimidating UI in AI products.
- Voice, image, and file inputs should feel first-class, not bolt-ons.
- Show length constraints only when approaching the limit. Otherwise, hide the infrastructure.

### Human-in-the-Loop Moments
- Identify actions that are irreversible or high-consequence. These require explicit human confirmation regardless of AI confidence.
- Confirmation dialogs must describe the action in plain language. Never "Are you sure?" — always "This will permanently delete 14 client records. This cannot be undone."
- **Preview before commit**: show the user what the AI intends to do before doing it.
- **Edit before apply**: AI-generated content should be editable before it affects state.

### Graceful Degradation
- AI features must degrade gracefully when the model is slow, rate-limited, or unavailable.
- Fallback states must be designed, not handled with a generic error message.
- Degraded mode should be functional. The core product must not become unusable because an AI feature is down.
- Retry logic should be transparent and user-controlled, not silent.

### AI Feature Anti-Patterns
- **The blank oracle**: A chat interface with no guidance, examples, or structure.
- **Silent failure**: An AI that returns nothing, returns garbage, or fails without communicating why.
- **Overexposed infrastructure**: Token counts, model names, temperature settings visible to users who didn't ask for them.
- **Magic without feedback**: Actions taken by AI without any explanation of what happened or why.
- **Generic AI aesthetic**: Purple gradient on white. Confident UI over uncertain output. Rounded everything.

## 08 — Design Systems Thinking

Think in systems, not in isolated mockups.

### Tokens First
Before building any component, establish the token layer:

```
-- Primitives (raw values):
   color-blue-500: #3B82F6
   space-4: 16px
   radius-md: 8px
   font-size-base: 16px

-- Semantic tokens (role-based):
   color-action-primary: {color-blue-500}
   space-component-padding: {space-4}
   radius-card: {radius-md}

-- Component tokens (component-scoped):
   button-background: {color-action-primary}
   card-padding: {space-component-padding}
```

This separation means theme changes happen at the token level, not in every component. One change propagates everywhere.

### Component Architecture
Every component should be:
- **Composable**: Built from smaller primitives, not monolithic.
- **Variant-driven**: Sizes, appearances, and states as explicit props — not one-off class overrides.
- **Context-agnostic**: A Button does not know it is in a Header. A Card does not know it is in a Dashboard.
- **Predictable**: The same input always produces the same output. No hidden stateful side-effects.

### Consistency as Trust
- Inconsistent spacing, inconsistent type sizes, inconsistent corner radii — these do not just look bad. They communicate to the user that the product is unfinished or untrustworthy.
- Every component should use only values from the token system. No hardcoded values except in tokens themselves.
- When you find yourself writing `margin-left: 13px`, stop. That is a signal that a token is missing or a layout assumption is wrong.

---

## 09 — Anti-Patterns (Avoid Always)

### Structural
- **Card cemetery**: A grid of equal-weight cards. Use hierarchy — not everything is equal.
- **Sidebar overload**: A left sidebar with 20+ items is not navigation. It is a list of features the product doesn't know how to organise.
- **Modal cascade**: A modal that opens another modal. A sign that a full page or drawer is needed.
- **Orphaned empty state**: An empty table or list with no call to action. Every empty state is an onboarding moment.
- **Settings as graveyard**: A settings section that is a dumping ground for everything that didn't fit elsewhere.

### Visual
- Purple gradient on white — the universal signal of generic AI output.
- Inter or Roboto as the only typeface — communicates nothing about the product.
- Ghost button as primary action — too low-contrast to carry the user's intent.
- Uniform corner radius on everything — monotonous and context-free.
- Icon-only navigation without labels (unless the product has strong established user training).
- Colour used as decoration, not as information.

### Interaction
- Hover states that change layout (cause reflow).
- Form submission that loses data on error.
- Destructive actions without confirmation.
- Full-page loading blocks for non-blocking operations.
- Success states that disappear before the user can read them (minimum 3 seconds).
- Tooltips as the only source of critical information — inaccessible on touch.

### Copy
- Button labels that describe the system's action, not the user's intention:
  - "Submit" → "Save changes"
  - "Confirm" → "Confirm booking"
  - "OK" → "Delete account"
- Error messages that apologise but do not help:
  - "An error occurred" → "We couldn't connect. Check your internet connection and try again."
- Placeholder text used as a label (disappears on input).
- Marketing copy inside a product interface. The user is already inside. They do not need to be sold to.
- Widows and orphans in paragraphs.

## 10 — Preferred Response Pattern for App Concepts

When asked to design an app or feature, respond in this structure:

### Summary
A concise concept of the product and who it serves. 2–3 sentences maximum.

### Product structure
Core areas, navigation, and why each exists.

### Main workflow
Step-by-step path for the primary job. Include what happens at the riskiest moment.

### Screen logic
What each main screen contains, its primary action, and what is hidden by default.

### States and edge cases
Empty, loading, error, permission-denied, long content, overflow, first-time vs. returning user.

### AI layer (if applicable)
How AI behaves, how trust and uncertainty are surfaced, how failure is handled, what requires human confirmation.

### System and styling direction
Visual direction chosen and why. Component logic. Token structure. Implementation notes.

### Recommendations
What to build now, what to defer, and what signals to watch before deciding.

## The Zypsy Standard

We believe the future of product design is one designer with the leverage of a team. AI is the multiplier. But a multiplier applied to low-quality input produces low-quality output at scale.

This skill exists to raise the floor. To ensure that AI-assisted interfaces start from real design thinking, not from pattern-matching on what a "dashboard" or "landing page" usually looks like.

The measure is not: "Does this look like a designed product?"

The measure is: "Does this make the user's job easier, faster, and less prone to error — and does it do so in a way that is beautiful, coherent, and trustworthy?"

If yes: ship it.

If no: go back to section 00.
